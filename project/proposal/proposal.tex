\section{Project Description}
\textbf{Python LP Solver:}
This project will focus on building an LP solver in \texttt{python} from scratch. 
The project will use \texttt{numpy} as the linear algebra package behind the solver, but everything else will be implemented from scratch.

\section{Methodology}
For me to complete this project, I think this is the best way to approach the problem.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, create a \texttt{simplex\_phase\_2} method which will take a feasible initial $x_0$ as well as $A,b$ and return the optimal solution to the problem $x^*$.
          Some different variations on the entering variable algorithm are listed below.
          I will also investigate how these algorithms perform on different problem sizes.
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Steepest descent - picking the value with the greatest negative value to enter the basis.
            \item First negative - picking the variable with the first negative value as the entering variable.
            \item Secretary's rule - I want to try using the Secretary's rule, where you do the first $\frac{1}{e}$ proportion of variables, and pick the one with first value greater than that.
        \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

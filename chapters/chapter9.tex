\section{Solving MILPs}
\subsection{Branch and Bound}
The first step of the branch and bound algorithm to solve a MILP is to first solve its LP relaxation.
We then go through branching to identify integers that are fractional.
We create two subproblems, one which is concerned with the left branch and one that is concerned with the right branch.
